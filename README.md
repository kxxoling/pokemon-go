# Pokemon Go Go Go!

## Design and implementation

The original design comes from Reddit user [@AlexKF0811](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexKF0811)
[posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4t5p7w/seeing_as_the_servers_were_down_today_i_decided/).

The Pokedex UI design comes from [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2475290-User-Profile-DailyUI-006).

And the design is invigorated and implemented by Kane Blueriver (@kxxoling) with Vue.js.
